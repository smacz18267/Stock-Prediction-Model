# Stock-Prediction-Model

This repository contains an advanced stock prediction system that uses a deep-learning model to predict stock prices based on historical data and technical indicators. The project is organized into separate backend and frontend folders.

**Disclaimer:** This project is a research and educational prototype. Stock prediction is inherently uncertain, and this model should not be used for real-world trading without extensive testing, validation, and risk management.

## Overview

This project implements a supervised learning model using a hybrid architecture that combines:
- Convolutional layers (Conv1D) for local feature extraction,
- Bidirectional LSTM layers for capturing temporal dependencies,
- A custom attention mechanism to weigh important time steps,
- Fully connected layers to produce a final stock price prediction.

Predictions are stored in a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy, and the model is exposed via a FastAPI backend. A simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend is provided to interact with the API.
